## lessonFiveProject.py

This file contains the Python code for the **Engage and Apply** and **Final Challenge** sections of the lesson. 

### Sections:
- **Engage and Apply**: 
  - A simple Python program to manage a list of favorite foods. The program allows the user to add, view, and remove foods from a list, which is saved to a file (`foods.txt`).
  - The program demonstrates file handling with basic operations such as writing to and reading from a file.

- **Final Challenge**: 
  - A TV show manager program where the user can add, remove, view, and now **edit** TV show details (platform or genre) in a file (`shows_list.txt`).
  - The challenge was extended to allow editing features and dynamic updates based on user interaction.

**Enhancements**:
- For **Engage and Apply**, I added functionality to check if the file exists before reading and added more informative print statements.
- For the **Final Challenge**, I modified the program to include the option to edit the platform or genre of existing TV shows.

## notes.py

This file contains the summarized notes and code examples for the lesson on **Python File Handling**.

### Sections:
- **Opening and Writing to Files**: Shows how to use `open()` with different modes (`'w'` for writing, `'a'` for appending).
- **Reading Files**: Demonstrates reading files using `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`.
- **Storing and Extracting Data**: Shows how to store structured data like lists and dictionaries into a file, and how to read them back.
- **Interactive Programs**: Covers creating an interactive menu to manage lists and dictionaries, providing a practical example of file handling in action.

**Purpose**:
- This file is a reference for learning how to handle files in Python, with examples for working with text files and structured data (lists and dictionaries).
